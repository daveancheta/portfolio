        problem: "Many Next.js developers face difficulties when integrating AI chatbots due to unclear or fragmented documentation, inconsistent API response handling, and the need to repeatedly build chatbot UI and backend logic from scratch. This often leads to wasted development time, duplicated code, and fragile implementations that are hard to scale or adapt to different AI providers.",
        solution: "Krave Docs addresses these challenges by providing a reusable chatbot UI and clear, step-by-step documentation tailored for Next.js developers. It offers structured backend examples for interacting with AI APIs, starting with Gemini and with OpenAI and Claude support planned. By separating frontend logic from AI providers, Krave Docs enables developers to integrate, reuse, and switch AI services easily, reducing boilerplate and accelerating development.",

        problem: "Many people rely on social media or delayed news updates to know when an earthquake has occurred. This can cause confusion, misinformation, and slow response times, especially for communities that need quick and reliable updates to stay safe and aware of seismic activity in their area.",
        solution: "ReQuake provides an easy-to-use web platform that displays real-time earthquake data in a clear and organized way. It allows users to quickly monitor recent seismic events, view affected locations, and stay informed without relying on scattered or unreliable sources. This helps the community stay aware, prepared, and responsive during earthquake situations.",

        solution: "Grindax provides a simple platform where users can list their favorite movies, mark films they’ve already watched, and organize their watchlist in one place. By centralizing movie tracking, Grindax helps the community easily manage their viewing history, discover favorites, and share movie interests with others.",

Renters lack visibility into their rentals, drivers have no clear assignment tracking, and admins struggle to monitor active rentals, availability, and overall operations efficiently.",
        solution: "CarVibe is a web-based car rental management system designed to support three user roles: renters, drivers, and administrators. It allows renters to track their bookings, drivers to view assigned trips, and admins to manage vehicles, rentals, and users in one centralized platform. This simplifies car rental operations and ensures clear coordination between all users involved.",

        solution: "SitterLy is a SaaS platform where parents can browse and hire babysitters easily, and babysitters can post their profiles with a “Hire Me” option. The platform centralizes service listings, allows secure online payments through PayMongo, and streamlines communication between parents and babysitters, making the process organized and reliable.",
