        problem: "Many people rely on social media or delayed news updates to know when an earthquake has occurred. This can cause confusion, misinformation, and slow response times, especially for communities that need quick and reliable updates to stay safe and aware of seismic activity in their area.",
        solution: "ReQuake provides an easy-to-use web platform that displays real-time earthquake data in a clear and organized way. It allows users to quickly monitor recent seismic events, view affected locations, and stay informed without relying on scattered or unreliable sources. This helps the community stay aware, prepared, and responsive during earthquake situations.",

        problem: "Movie lovers often struggle to keep track of the films they’ve already watched or the ones they plan to watch. Lists are usually scattered across notes, screenshots, or different apps, making it inconvenient to manage personal movie collections and share recommendations within the community.",
        solution: "Grindax provides a simple platform where users can list their favorite movies, mark films they’ve already watched, and organize their watchlist in one place. By centralizing movie tracking, Grindax helps the community easily manage their viewing history, discover favorites, and share movie interests with others.",

        problem: "Managing rented cars can be confusing when there is no centralized system for tracking bookings, drivers, and vehicle status. Renters lack visibility into their rentals, drivers have no clear assignment tracking, and admins struggle to monitor active rentals, availability, and overall operations efficiently.",
        solution: "CarVibe is a web-based car rental management system designed to support three user roles: renters, drivers, and administrators. It allows renters to track their bookings, drivers to view assigned trips, and admins to manage vehicles, rentals, and users in one centralized platform. This simplifies car rental operations and ensures clear coordination between all users involved.",

        problem: "Parents often struggle to find reliable babysitters online because information is scattered across social media and different platforms. Babysitters have no centralized place to advertise their services, and managing bookings or payments is cumbersome without a proper system.",
        solution: "SitterLy is a SaaS platform where parents can browse and hire babysitters easily, and babysitters can post their profiles with a “Hire Me” option. The platform centralizes service listings, allows secure online payments through PayMongo, and streamlines communication between parents and babysitters, making the process organized and reliable.",
